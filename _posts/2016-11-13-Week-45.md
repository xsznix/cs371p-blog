title: Life is hard sometimes
---

**What did you do this past week?** This past week I was more worried about other things than with class. I decided to skip all my classes on Wednesday (a first and hopefully last for me) because I stayed up late following the presidential election and decided that I would rather miss class and take a grade hit than have to wake up early to go to class and be miserable and not pay attention to anything anyway. Learning about inheritance in C++ made me really aware of how complex implementing object-oriented programming is in practice when you consider how many different edge cases there are. For example, what happens if you override a public virtual method with a private one? What if you override a non-virtual method with a virtual one? Is it ever useful to have a private virtual method?

**What's in your way?** This coming week is going to be hella busy and I will probably die. Not to say that I wouldn't die otherwise, because we all die in the end...

**What will you next week?** Literally everything. I haven't started the Life project because I cancelled on my partner last week (with her permission, of course) to go vote. And then this happensâ€¦

**Tip of the week!** As you can see in the image above, I keep track of all my assignments not in a traditional to-do list but in a Gantt chart, which I think lets you better visualize when you need to set aside time for things. The one I use it [Teamweek](https://teamweek.com), but there are plenty of similar (and better) Gantt chart services online.

Gantt charts are more useful in the workplace, where tasks are not just independent events with due dates but rather events that depend on each other and need more careful scheduling and timing to prioritize and maximize efficiency and throughput. Seeing it on a chart helps tremendously; if you're working on A because you need A to be done so you can start working on B but B also depends on C which depends on D, which another team is working on, and you could also work on E in the meantime but F is high priority and requires B to be done first... everything gets really hard to keep track of mentally.
