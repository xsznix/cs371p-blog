**What did you do this past week?** I stayed up late several nights doing two assignments that ended up taking several hours each. Fortunately, there weren't any OOP projects to add on top of all of that, otherwise I might have literally died from all the stress.

**What's in your way?** I'm slowly realizing the implications of many of the design decisions in C++. C++ assumes that you know what you're doing and will let you do just about anything. Neat features such as operator overloading and automatic type conversion are nice if you know what you're doing, but in the real world, very few people actually know what they're doing, and even less so when people work together in teams that have less than ideal communication between them. This allows programmers to write subtle bugs that can take a long time to detect because of the opaqueness of the language. In contrast, many of the design decisions in Rust aim to make the semantics of a program more transparent, which I think will make it easier for programmers to write robust code in Rust than C++.

On another note, I found questions 1 and 2 on Friday's quiz to be confusingly worded. This is somewhat concerning to me, even though said questions were thrown out in grading, because I'm afraid I'll see similar questions on the exam. I really hope that the questions on the exam next week will use technical terminology correctly and explain the premise and answer choices well. I think a quiz or test question should exhibit *at least* the amount of attention to detail in its construction as it requires of the answerer in solving it.

**What will you do next week?** I may study for an hour or two for the test. However, I think for this class, the most useful way of studying would be to pay attention to all of the details of C++ that are mentioned in lecture, since questions about C++ minutiae are likely to be the most difficult parts of the exam. In that case, my studying would consist of going to class and paying attention to lecture, and then maybe looking over the posted lecture notes a few times to make sure I understand all the semantics.
