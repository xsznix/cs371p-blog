title: The First Real Week
---

On the side of changes since I took OOP, it looks like Dr. Downing has opted for using a two Git remotes. And this year's Collatz project is on HackerRank instead of the older-looking website we used two semesters ago.

## What did you do this past week?

I only have classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I don't have homework due until the third week, so at first it didn't really feel like school was back in season again.

The quiz question about the extreme programming process threw me off. Admittedly, I didn't do the reading, but even those who did do the reading struggled with the problem. But that's okay. I thought all the other quiz questions were fair, even if I didn't get all of them. I've learned my lesson: read the questions at the bottom of each day's lecture notes.

I went to the UT Competitive Programming tryouts after some strong encouragement from Dr. Downing and scored 7th out of 200-something people who attended. That's all right, I guess, but the discrepancy in score between me and the top 6 is quite frightening and I doubt I'd be much help in regionals if *all* the schools are sending their best like UT's best.

## What's in your way?

The biggest thing on my mind right now is recruiting. I want to get recruiting done as early as possible, and that means I'll have to go to the career fair and actually talk to people.

Also, homework is starting to pick up, and I'm going to have to start managing my time more carefully from now on.

## What will you do next week?

Collatz is due this week, so I have to write tests and documentation. Recruiting will be heavy this week as well. I also have to prepare audition material for [Re:Sound](https://www.facebook.com/resoundacappella/), which I'm leading this year.

## What's your experience of the class?

The class is more or less exactly what I expect from Dr. Downing, so it'd be kinda boring for me to regurgitate what everyone else has said about the lectures. Suffice to say, so far so good.

I'll give a bit of opinion instead: I don't like how there are spaces before colons in all of our provided code. People just don't write Python like that.
