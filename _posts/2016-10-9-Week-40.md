title: there was no class on friday
---

**What did you do this past week?** Most notably, the test on Thursday. Having a cheat sheet with all the function signatures helped a suspiciously high amount. Dr. Downing himself said that cheat sheets aren't supposed to be useful during the test. As for lecture, going through the different types of constants was basically review from back when I read halfway through a book explaining C pointers. Going through the different types of casting was new and interesting, although I don't recall `dynamic_cast` and `reinterpret_cast` being mentioned in class (did I forget?). To be fair, I'd understand if Dr. Downing didn't want to go through them because they are inherently less safe.

**What's in your way?** I looked at the Project 3 spec on the class website and it is nowhere close to a complete spec. Hopefully Dr. Downing can explain the full project requirements in class on Monday.

**What will you do next week?** I'll get started on Project 3, of course. The past week was really relaxing (in relative terms, of course) because there was no OOP project to worry about doing just right.

## Tip of the week

[Learn JavaScript, it's a great language and the ecosystem is super helpful and everything makes sense!](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.h78a86rsx) Hah, just kidding. This is where my job security for the next several decades will come from.

## Where did O(n^2 log n) come from?

One of my friends (who shall not be named unless he wants credit) pointed out a mistake in [@344](https://piazza.com/class/irybyipu8yu6jd?cid=344). In particular, the following statement is ~patently false~ misleading:

```
sort with LinkedList becomes n^2 log n
```

Additionally, Java's sorting algorithm is not always quicksort. [`Collections.sort` actually implements mergesort, while `Arrays.sort` is quicksort.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32334319/why-does-collections-sort-use-mergesort-but-arrays-sort-does-not) It turns out that calling `sort` on a `LinkedList` in Java does not have `n^2 log n` time complexity, but rather only `n log n`; [mergesort takes `n log n` time on linked lists](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/algorithms/listsort.html). [In fact, performing quicksort on a `LinkedList` also takes `n log n` time](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quicksort-for-linked-list/). (EDIT: "I didn't say that Java sort was n^2 log n. I said that if you naively implement sort with the List interface and then use LinkedList that that's what would happen.") For a class that places this much emphasis on small details, I would like to see this small detail ~fixed~ clarified in future semesters' lectures.
