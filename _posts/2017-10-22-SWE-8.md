## What did you do this past week?

This week was the last week of college that's dominated by recruiting. I had an interview on Thursday that I was trying to avoid red-eye flights for and my return flight ended up being a red-eye anyway because apparently SFO is among the most delayed airports in the US. So I skipped class on Friday.

This weekend, I went home and discussed my job offers with my parents to get their input. And all throughout the past two weeks, I've been asking for opinions from friends, family, and even interviewers what I should be considering and prioritizing when it comes to picking where I want to work after I graduate.

## What's in your way?

My parents had a pretty good idea of where they thought I should go, so I've all but decided by this point. I don't want to talk about the reasoning publicly, but I'll mention the company after I accept an offer tomorrow!

## What will you do next week?

I don't seem to have anything due this coming week besides IDB2, so I can basically dedicate my entire week to the project. It's only fairâ€”I didn't do any work on the project last week because I was flying out to interview.

## What's your experience of the class?

I don't think anything particularly stood out to me during class this past week. I also missed class on Friday, so lecture isn't exactly fresh on my mind right now.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Run a background check on every company that wants to hire you by looking at reviews on Glassdoor. That way you can find red flags pretty quickly, such as this gem in the pros and cons section of [Amazon Austin](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Amazon-Austin-Reviews-EI_IE6036.0,6_IL.7,13_IM60.htm):

It's pretty telling when both cons of a company are about bad work-life balance, and even one of the pros is bad work-life balance.
