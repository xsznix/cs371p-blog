title: Murphy and Hofstadter walk into a bar
---

**What did you do this past week?** We covered the details of the first project on Monday and Wednesday, and on Friday we talked about some considerations for coverage testing and motivation for C++ exceptions. I suggested several changes to the project, including small tweaks in the base code as well as suggesting that we use pull requests for contributions to the public test repo. (How has nobody suggested this before me?) Professor Downing was very receptive to these suggestions and accepted most of them.

**What's in your way?** The project spec is still a bit unclear in some places, even if by design. What's bothering me the most for the Collatz project specifically is that testing helper functions would require exposing them in the header file. Additionally, I believe that in principle, such private helper functions should not be tested because ["[a] private method [or private helper functions] is an implementation detail that should be hidden to the users of the class. Testing private methods [or private helper functions] breaks encapsulation."](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/105007/should-i-test-private-methods-or-only-public-ones)

**What will you do next week?** Next week I will turn in the Collatz project. Hopefully the reviewers will get to my pull request on the test repo soon. I added some extra goodies, including a Makefile, .gitignore, and a filled-out README.md that I think will be helpful for other test writers. (Unfortunately, it turns out they don't want to make the tests more helpful because they rejected the extra goodies.)

## Pre-increment vs. post-increment

On Friday, Professor Downing claimed that pre-increment performs better than post-increment operators in C++ when using iterators because post-increment creates a temporary rvalue. I was skeptical that this would yield any sort of real-world improvements because most of the time the compiler can optimize away the unnecessary copy. But as it turns out, [this is widely recommended and regarded as a best-practice](https://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/59880/avoid-postfix-increment-operator). As such, I will keep this tip in mind in the future whenever I write C++. Thanks Professor for pointing this out.

## Exception handling

The other big practical tip covered in class on Friday was also not familiar to me (you can maybe tell I haven't done much C++ programming in the past): "throw by value, catch by (const) reference." The claim is that throwing by value ensures that we don't allocate some memory on the heap that a catch block somewhere will have to free later, and catching by reference ensures that we avoid unnecessary copies of the exception itself while unwinding the stack and that we avoid slicing if the exception thrown subclasses the exception caught.

Additionally, I would recommend adding const when you catch the exception so that the compiler can optimize more by assuming that you won't modify the contents of the exception, which you shouldn't do anyway.

Checking online, I had some trouble finding out specifics about the C++ exception handling mechanisms in terms of how copies work differently in catch-by-reference and catch-by-value, but I did find that C++ exceptions have their own thread-local stack separate from the rest of the stack. So that answers the question of where the exception is placed in memory when you throw it by value. I don't think that catching an exception on the exception stack by reference would require a copy, since it's already in a safe, live place in memory, so I would guess that the single copy mentioned in class from the exception stack to the catching function's stack is not necessary, but I'm not confident in this.

While researching this claim, I found [an insightful and detailed blog post](https://monoinfinito.wordpress.com/series/exception-handling-in-c/) about how C++ exception handling works internally, if anybody's interested. In any case, I can vouch for "throw by value, catch by reference" and I will make sure to do that when writing C++ in the future.

## Suggesting changes to projects

I was very relieved at Professor Downing's receptiveness to my suggested changes, because in other classes the project description is basically a god and challenging the project description can earn you an eternity in damnation and a stern reprimand from the instructors for questioning their authority. But as this class aims to teach current industry practices and those practices keep changing faster than one can keep up, it's really helpful that the instructors are willing to change their projects to match these practices.

## another commit

When Professor Downing considered my suggestions for changes to the base code, he didn't accept [my pull request](https://github.com/gpdowning/cs371p/pull/1) but rather chose to re-implement my suggested changes himself after I sent him more detailed rationale for each suggestion:

[*"Make meaningful **commit messages** identifying the corresponding **issue** in the **issue tracker**."*](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs371p/projects/Collatz.html)

I thought that was pretty interesting.

## Timing your work

One of the requirements of the Collatz project is to estimate how much time the project will take and then track how much time it actually takes. This is an excellent demonstration of two of my favorite laws, Murphy's law and Hofstadter's law.

Murphy's law states:

> Everything that can go wrong will go wrong.

This is especially true in programming, especially with the tremendous complexity of the machines and software we're using. Docker won't work, Travis won't work, the Makefile will be broken, your tests will pass when you don't want them to, UVa won't accept your solution even when you've verified that it works perfectly, and every other possible stupid time-waster will be thrown your way exactly when you need everything to just work because you started the project the day before it was due. It's just the nature of life, and all of the unpredictable obstacles dramatically increase the time it takes to write software compared to how much you think you need. Speaking of which... Hofstadter's law states:

> It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

So basically, expect the project to take about twice as long as you think it will. And once you've set that expectation, expect it to take longer than that anyway. I thought that I could do the Collatz project in a chill ten hours a week, but in reality I've spent that long just answering questions on Piazza and fixing small quirks in the base code that have nothing to do with the actual project solution.

## Pick of the Week

Continuing from last week's pick, let me introduce [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), a powerful keyboard shortcut remapper. Among other things, I use it to bind custom keyboard shortcuts to the heavily under-utilized function layer on my Mac, allowing me to make nice, mnemonic keyboard shortcuts for window management actions as well as other various actions that I can be sure that no existing app-specific keyboard shortcut can conflict with. Karabiner has other cool preset customizations, such as using emacs- or vi-style shortcuts system-wide, although I'm personally not as much of a fan of these.

## Tip of the Week

Do your own research of claims in class. Individual exploration is a great way to reinforce the concepts taught in class, and having a deep understanding of why the professor claims what he does in class will help you when you are asked to synthesize new, related claims on quizzes and tests. And occasionally, you can catch some small details that were hand-waved over in class (it happens much more often than you'd expect!), which further reinforces your understanding of the overall concept and makes you a fun person to talk to at parties.
