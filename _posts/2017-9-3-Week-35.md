Two semesters ago, I took OOP with Dr. Downing and gave a fair amount of feedback on the class. This semester, I'll be paying close attention to what has changed between then and now.

From a quick glance at the course website, it looks like the tests are no longer only writing code, and the code writing has moved to HackerRank, whose text editor is much better suited for coding than Canvas. This is a welcome change; I remarked in a post last year that a test comprised solely of writing code wasn't a good indicator of students' performance.

## What are your expectations of the class?

People I know who've taken both OOP and SWE with Dr. Downing have said that they are very similar classes. I am coming into this class with that expectation, and thus I hope to gain from this class deep and comprehensive understanding of Python language semantics. Since Python is wildly popular (as is C++, which I learned in OOP), I'm confident that I'll be able to apply what I learn in this class in many situations in the future.

## What did you do this past week?

Last week was syllabus week, so that means there's nothing particularly interesting to write about.

## What's in your way?

I think the biggest unknown for me at this point is my assigned team members for projects 2 through 5. I'm fluent enough in JS and React that I'd be comfortable doing the entire frontend by myself for whatever we build, but I want to work with someone who knows backend and databases well enough that I won't have to handle that as well.

## What will you do next week?

Next week I may start on the first project, which I'm expecting to be fairly trivial. It's still early in the semester, so these posts will be more interesting once things start to pick up.

## What's your experience of the class?

Friday's class was, I think, pretty representative of my experience with Dr. Downing's classes. Calling on names in class, asking questions, and having a lively discussion are all very characteristic of this professor, and having had a Downing class before, I'm familiar and comfortable with it. (People who don't usually participate in class though may not feel as good about forced participation, though.)

## What's your pick-of-the-week?

Minecraft is a great game to play to exercise your muscles for design, but if you're like me and you want to cut out all the tedious parts of Minecraft, you can download modpacks in [Technic Launcher](https://www.technicpack.net/). Most recently, I've been playing Tekkit Legends. (The picture above is a dark matter *pick*axe (get it?), which is included in Tekkit Legends.) Many modpacks in the Technic Launcher enable you to build complex machines to automate basically anything you'd want to do in Minecraft, and I think it's a great way to practice the same sort of puzzle-solving and overly-sparse-documentation-reading skills that you will be using every day in your career as a software engineer.
